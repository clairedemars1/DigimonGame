Project description: Make it a full game

The easiest part of this project: god mode

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
Same problem as last project: the keyboard drivers on the lab computers don't respect the SDL key down event thing, so for a single press of the j key, you can get 2 SDL key-was-pressed-down events. Therefore I didn't get to test how the jump key will behave on computers that actually do what SDL says to do. I also had bugs with initilization of multiple things at once, and with thinking that things were inserted at the front of a list, when they're actually inserted at the back.

Notes:
	
 - notes on design:
	+ I moved key detection for movement (asdw) into player for better encapsulation

 - sources and work I did altering them:

     removed 5 sets of leaves, bus, bushes, and electrical towers. For edges matching, could not just flip - b/c of direction clouds were blowing - so duplicated 3 times and adjusted clouds on edges. Separated into 5 layers. Adjusted the layers' heights.
