 - compilation:
   command: make
   dependencies: SDL 2.0, c++11
 
 - features:
	+ simple pursuit AI
	+ collision detection for fireballs, player, enemies
	+ chunking and frame-based explosions
	+ projectiles (fireballs)
	+ jumping
	+ data driven design (drawing from data file without need to recompile)
	+ Painter's algorithm and parallax scrolling for illusion of depth
	+ object pooling (fireballs)
	+ encapsulation of command key detection within Player class
	+ image editing: Guassian blur, layer separation, drawing
	+ no user-code memory leaks
	+ sound effects and music
	+ god mode and reset option
	+ HUD (heads up display) with timeout and redisplay options


 - OO patterns used:
	+ factory flyweight: frameFactory.cpp textureWrapper.cpp
	+ strategy: collisionStrategy.cpp
	+ template method: 
	+ object pool: bulletPool.cpp
	+ singleton: ioMod.cpp gamedata.cpp frameFactory.cpp
	+ composite reuse principle: twoWayExplodingMultiSprite.cpp explodingSprite.cpp
