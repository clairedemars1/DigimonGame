Project description: Make it a full game

The easiest part of this project: 

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
	

Notes:

 - game plan: 
	goal - the player's goal is get to the right-most end of the world without dying. There are obstacles, either digital monsters (patrolling back and forth like in donkey kong) or rocks/bushes. They can shoot the monsters into bits (explosions), and jump either kind of obstacles. They can also jump to catch something in the sky ( maybe digivices), which help them level up (digivolve) into a higher stage. 
	Not sure what to do for AI yet. 
	Sprite source - online with alterations (blurring, etc).
	Music - digimon theme song and ca-ching noises for getting points.
	
 - notes on design:
	+ I moved key detection for movement (asdw) into player for better encapsulation

 - image sources and work I did altering them:
 
     backgrounds - http://dr-roflcopter.deviantart.com/art/Digimon-Adventure-Tri-Train-Wallpaper-523992542
     removed 5 sets of leaves, bus, bushes, and electrical towers. For edges matching, could not just flip - b/c of direction clouds were blowing - so duplicated 3 times and adjusted clouds on edges. Separated into 5 layers. Adjusted the layers' heights.
