priorities
- DONE enable jumping, check that he cannot fly
- DONE enable aswd only if he's in y range, or at the top and moving down
- put obstacles (bushes or taller rocks), with collision detection so velocity -> 0 if he hits the while going right if on their left, left if on their right
- DONEadd patrolling bad guys, 
- if he lands near them they chase him
- DONEif they catch him he explodes
- DONEbullets: if they collide with bad guys they explode
- DONEgod mode
- reset
- DONE music
- noise on explosion
- make jump multi-level

- digivices falling from sky, they explode and you gain points if they hit you

jumping

how to jump:
hold longer -> jump higher
check not only if j key is being pressed but if had been in the prev frame, up to 4, 
start jump arch as soon as it's pressed, but increase y vel each time

if that's jumpy, ignore gravity while holding j key (up to 4 frames)

decision: 
	- can only jump if on ground, holding j down longer make it jump higher
	- jump is only way to change y position
	- size of jump (height, & thus length) depends on how long player held down the jump key to start the jumping
	- left and right keys have no effect while character is jumping
	- i will not have levels, the only level is the ground
	if i did have levels, then couldn't check y to see if was jumping (to see if could use left and right keys), so i'd need "isJumping" bool. i will use that for extensibility.
	- uncertainty: don't i need to limit how long they can hold down the jump key for, else they could fly away
